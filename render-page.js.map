For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n *\n *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n *\n * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n *\n * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n *\n * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n * if it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n *\n *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n *\n * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n *\n * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n *\n *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n *     }\n *\n * All Immutable collections are Value Objects: they implement `equals()`\n * and `hashCode()`.\n */\nfunction is(valueA, valueB) {\n  if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  if (\n    typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n    typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function'\n  ) {\n    valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n    valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return !!(\n    isValueObject(valueA) &&\n    isValueObject(valueB) &&\n    valueA.equals(valueB)\n  );\n}\n\nvar imul =\n  typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2\n    ?

It enables\n          these frameworks to offer a simple and intuitive layout API that\n          allows for engineers to collaborate more easily across platforms. Yoga\n          has unlocked exciting features such as calculating layouts off of the\n          main thread to help ensure smooth UI performance.\n        </p>\n      </Col>\n    </Row>\n    <div className=\"logo-group\">\n      <a href=\"https://fblitho.com\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"logo\">\n        <img src={LithoLogo} />\n        <h3>Litho</h3>\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://componentkit.org\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"logo\">\n        <img src={ComponentKitLogo} />\n        <h3>ComponentKit</h3>\n      </a>\n      <a\n        href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react-native/\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        className=\"logo\">\n        <img src={ReactNativeLogo} />\n        <h3>React Native</h3>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </Padded>\n);\n\nconst AboutSectionTwo = () => (\n  <Padded className=\"about-section\">\n    <Row>\n      <Col xl={16} lg={16} md={24} sm={24} xs={24}>\n        <h1>Why You May Consider Yoga</h1>\n\n        <h3>PERFORMANCE</h3>\n        <p>\n          Yoga was built to be fast and performance will always be one of Yoga's\n          primary goals. For a layout engine to be able to power any range of\n          applications, it needs to be fast and never stand in the way of a\n          fluid user experience.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>CROSS PLATFORM</h3>\n        <p>\n          Yoga is built with cross platform in mind. To ensure Yoga can be used\n          anywhere, it was written in portable C/C++ and has a low number of\n          dependencies and small binary size. This means Yoga can be used on iOS\n          and Android, sharing knowledge, and potentially code, between\n          platforms.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>EASY TO LEARN</h3>\n        <p>\n          Yoga is easy to pick up and learn. The interactive documentation pages\n          and a fully fledged layout editor makes it easy to play and learn all\n          the features. If used with any of the major UI frameworks the layout\n          editor even provides code generation.\n        </p>\n      </Col>\n    </Row>\n  </Padded>\n);\n\nexport default () => (\n  <Page
